    <h2 style="font-family:Brush Script MT">The Characters (Least to Most Annoying or Interesting) </h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Henry</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Very smart and makes a lot of intersting references.</li>
          <li>Horrible person. Likes murder. Finds it exhilerating.</li>
          <li>
          He's a very interesting character. It's fun to try and analyze his
          decisions and character, even though you can only see so much from
          Richard's perspective of him
          </li>
        </ul>
      <li>Francis</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
          He's a very good friend (?) to Richard. It's interesting to see them
          get close throughout the novel.
          </li>
          <li>
          I can feel his anxiety from the very beginning onward. So real for
          that.
          </li>
          <li>Some of the stuff he says is really funny actually.</li>
          <li>
          I like trying to figure out how much he knows at any given time.
          Because I think he knows about probably the most of what's going on at
          any given time. He may not have made the plans or have
          <em>complete</em> knowledge of them, but I think he knows a lot just
          because he remains close with almost everyone in the group for nearly
          the entire novel.
          </li>
        </ul>
      <li>Camilla</li>
        <ul>
          <li>think that Camilla is just as messed up and cold as Henry (or at least pretty close),
              but Richard ignores it because she's a girl. </li>
          <li>I honestly can't figure out her personality that well though because Richard has such
              a stupidly bad understanding of her. His judgement is completey clouded by his little crush on her.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Charles</li>
        <ul>
          <li>I liked him less and less as the book goes on.</li>
          <li>Also, I'm not sure he was completely wrong about Henry. Like he was definetely paranoid, 
              but Henry was <strong>NOT</strong> happy with him.</li>
          <li>I think it's very interesting how he seems to have the most moral objections to anyhting
              that happens (I believe he was the most opposed to Bunny's murder), but ends up getting
              so paranoid that he tries to kill Henry (he lost the moral objections somewhere in there). 
            I also like the detail of him being a good shot, but I wish it was included earlier in the book. </li>
          <li>I think had some of these things not happened, he and Richard would have stayed good friends. </li>
        </ul>
      <li>Richard</li>
        <ul>
          <li>He just really annoys me. Why is he <em>so annoying</em>??</li>
          <li>So many of the bad things that happen to him really are his fault. </li>
          <li>I need him to stop thinking like that. Also, he needs to get over Camilla and stop having
              weird thoughts about her. It's annoying. </li>
          <li>I think in many ways, he holds himself apart from the group because he doesn't feel like he 
              fully belongs in the group, and that's part of why he has this dynamic where he's both kind 
              of in and kind of out of the group. </li>
          <li> I do wonder why's he writing the story now, and what he's going to do with it? I think it 
              has a lot to do with the autobiographies of serial killers he has read, but then what's he
              planning? Will he eventually let someone see it? Would he endanger his old friends like that? 
              Or is he writing it because he cannot sleep or something and he's trying to get over it 
              (he never will). </li>
        </ul>
      <li>Bunny</li>
        <ul>
          <li>He's just straight up annoying. </li>
          <li>I kind of understand why they killed him. He's really that annoying. </li>
          <li>My main question is, if he at least suspected that they were going to kill 
            him, why didn't he try to get away? I mean maybe it was just a drunken paranoia,
            but I would've thought he would try and leave. Or at least not going on a walk alone
            in the woods...</li>
      </ul>
    </ol>

    <p>
      One of the most interesting aspects of Tartt's writing, which is very prevalent across her novels, 
      is the idea of ghosts. She often writes them as appearing at times of sickness or while the characters 
      are in hospitals, making small actions, but with a clear distinction between their world and the world 
      of the characters. It is too late for them.

                          everywhere have always known that. And we believe in them every bit as much as Homer 
                          did. Only now, we call them by different names. Memory. the unconcious.">
