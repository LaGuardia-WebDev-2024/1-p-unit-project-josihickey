    <h3>The Characters (Least to Most Annoying)</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Henry</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Very smart and makes a lot of intersting references.</li>
          <li>Horrible person. Likes murder. Finds it exhilerating.</li>
          <li>
          He's a very interesting character. It's fun to try and analyze his
          decisions and character, even though you can only see so much from
          Richard's perspective of him
          </li>
        </ul>
      <li>Francis</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
          He's a very good friend (?) to Richard. It's interesting to see them
          get close throughout the novel.
          </li>
          <li>
          I can feel his anxiety from the very beginning onward. So real for
          that.
          </li>
          <li>Some of the stuff he says is really funny actually.</li>
          <li>
          I like trying to figure out how much he knows at any given time.
          Because I think he knows about probably the most of what's going on at
          any given time. He may not have made the plans or have
          <em>complete</em> knowledge of them, but I think he knows a lot just
          because he remains close with almost everyone in the group for nearly
          the entire novel.
          </li>
        </ul>
      <li>Camilla</li>
        <ul>
          <li>think that Camilla is just as messed up and cold as Henry (or at least pretty close), but Richard                 ignores it because she's a girl. </li>
          <li>I honestly can't figure out her personality that well though because Richard has such a stupidly bad               understanding of her. His judgement is completey clouded by his little crush on her.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Charles</li>
      <li>Richard</li>
      <li>Bunny</li>
    </ol>
